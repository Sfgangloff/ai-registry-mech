# Internal audit of autonolas-staking-programmes
The review has been performed based on the contract code in the following repository:<br>
`https://github.com/valory-xyz/ai-registry-mech` <br>
commit: `05ff5b68a7ff506ab8d0f0feca4015408f067979` <br> 

## Objectives
The audit focused on contracts in this repo. <br>
Limits: The subject of the audit is not contracts used as library contracts. Thus, this audit is not a full-fledged audit of contracts underlying the contract ERC721Mech. <br>

### Flatten version
Flatten version of contracts. [contracts](https://github.com/valory-xyz/ai-registry-mech/blob/main/audits/internal/analysis/contracts) 

### ERC20/ERC721 checks

### Security issues. Updated 30-10-2023
#### Problems found instrumentally
Several checks are obtained automatically. They are commented. <br>
All automatic warnings are listed in the following file, concerns of which we address in more detail below: <br>
[slither-full](https://github.com/valory-xyz/autonolas-staking-programmes/blob/main/audits/internal/analysis/slither_full.txt) 
Most of the issues raised by instrumental analysis are outside the scope of the audit. <br>

##### For re-checking and discussion. False positive?
```
INFO:Detectors:
ExtendedAgentFactory.addMech(address,uint256,uint256) (ExtendedAgentFactory-flatten.sol#3933-3956) calls abi.encodePacked() with multiple dynamic arguments:
	- byteCode = abi.encodePacked(byteCode,abi.encode(registry,agentId,price)) (ExtendedAgentFactory-flatten.sol#3944)
Reference: https://github.com/crytic/slither/wiki/Detector-Documentation#abi-encodePacked-collision
Example problem:
keccak256(abi.encodePacked(name, doc));
id1 =  (bob, This is the content)
id2 = (bo, bThis is the content)
id1 == id2
abi.encode uses padding while abi.encodePacked does not. abi.encodePacked whatever will work.
```

##### Update library contracts as possible
Contracts used as libraries include those that are obviously not needed in the "product" mode. <br> 
```bash
grep -r console ./lib/mech/contracts/    
./lib/mech/contracts/base/ImmutableStorage.sol:import "hardhat/console.sol";
```

##### What happens to the incoming native token?
```solidity
contract AgentMech is ERC721Mech {
function request(bytes memory data) external payable returns (uint256 requestId) {
    if (msg.value < price) {
            revert NotEnoughPaid(msg.value, price);
        }

```

##### Very minor issue.
lacks a zero-check on: <br>
```solidity
contract AgentFactory is GenericManager {
constructor(address _agentRegistry) {
        agentRegistry = _agentRegistry;
        owner = msg.sender;
    }

contract AgentMech is ERC721Mech {
        // Record the price
        price = _price;
...
}
```
